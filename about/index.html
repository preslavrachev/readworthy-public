        <p><em>More about me <a href="https://preslav.me/about">on my blog</a>.</em></p>

<p>We are drowning in information, but lost for meaning. The Internet is the best, but also, the worst thing that has happened to the written word. The Internet opened the world to underrepresented groups of society, letting them speak their minds Yet, it also gave savvy opportunists a platform to sell everyone anything at all times, disguising it behind what looks like clever writing.</p>

<p>I have long been struggling to find genuine and meaningful writing online. It is out there waiting to be discovered, but there is so much content fighting for the reader&rsquo;s attention that quality writing often gets buried under piles of clickbaity titles and flashing media.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I created this site. I am not alone in my endeavour. To help me on my mission, I have created a piece of software trained to distinguish true writing value. It helps sift through the pile and find hidden gems. The rest is good old careful and critical reading, until something ends up in this collection.</p>

<p>Welcome aboard, and I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

<p>Preslav</p>
