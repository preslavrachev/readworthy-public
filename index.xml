      <description>More about me on my blog.
We are drowning in information, but lost for meaning. The Internet is the best, but also, the worst thing that has happened to the written word. The Internet opened the world to underrepresented groups of society, letting them speak their minds Yet, it also gave savvy opportunists a platform to sell everyone anything at all times, disguising it behind what looks like clever writing.</description>
